# 🗺 Path Finder using Graph (BFS / DFS)

## 📖 Project Idea
This project finds a **path between two cities** using **Graph traversal algorithms (BFS or DFS)**.  
The user inputs city connections, and the algorithm determines whether a route exists between two selected cities.

## ⚙️ Algorithm Overview

### 1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- Explores all neighbours level by level.
- Finds the **shortest path** in an unweighted graph.

### 2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Explores as deep as possible along a branch before backtracking.
- Finds **any valid path**, not necessarily the shortest.
